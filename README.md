# DEGIRO to Ghostfolio

This tool allows you to convert a [DEGIRO](https://www.degiro.nl) transaction export (CSV) to an import file that can be read by [Ghostfolio](https://github.com/ghostfolio/ghostfolio/). 

# DEPRECATION NOTICE

The tool has been moved to [another repo](https://github.com/dickwolff/Export-to-Ghostfolio) and integrated in a more generic solution. This allows the addition of other export tools and keeps them all in one place. If you have any issues with a previous version of this tool, please try the new one and create an issue there if the problem persists. Thanks!
